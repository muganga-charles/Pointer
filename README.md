# Pointer
The "two number arithmetic.c" file creates an array and then stores two values inside that array.<br />
The program then arrows a user to enter any arithmetic they would want to work with,<br />
The program users functions to work with diffrent arithmetic operations.<br />
These then retun the result and it is printed to the user
The program then loops to allow a user make other operations.
If he doesnot want to make any, the he enters two numbers and the takes the option of quit to stop the program.
