# Pointer<br />
The "two number arithmetic.c" file creates an array and then stores two values inside that array.<br />
The program then arrows a user to enter any arithmetic they would want to work with,<br />
The program users functions to work with diffrent arithmetic operations.<br />
These then retun the result and it is printed to the user.<br />
The program then loops to allow a user make other operations.<br />
If he doesnot want to make any, then they enter two numbers and the takes the option of quit to stop the program.//
